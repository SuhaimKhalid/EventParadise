# Fix All Errors in EventParadise BackEnd

## Issues Identified

- Database seeding errors: duplicate key violations, missing tables
- Authentication failures in tests (401 Unauthorized)
- Missing data in tests (404 Not Found)
- Duplicate user registration (409 Conflict)

## Plan

1. Fix seeds.ts to properly drop and reset sequences
2. Ensure tables are created in correct order
3. Review test setup for database reset before each test
4. Fix authentication in test files (login and token usage)
5. Run tests to verify all fixes

## Progress

- [x] Analyze test files for setup and auth issues
- [x] Edit seeds.ts for proper DB reset
- [x] Edit test files for auth fixes
- [x] Run tests and verify
